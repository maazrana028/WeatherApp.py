# WeatherApp.py
This is a weather app using API keys from OpenWeather.com.
This app is created by pulling "requests" API from a website "OpenWeather.com" 
What is Open weather?. well, Lets hear from them... "OpenWeather is a team of IT experts and data scientists that has been practising deep weather data science since 2014. For each point on the globe, OpenWeather provides historical, current and forecasted weather data via light-speed APIs." 
Link to the site : https://openweathermap.org/
Speaking of API, an Application Programming Interfaceaccording to Amazon is defined as "mechanisms that enable two or more software components to communicate with each other using a set of definations & protocols." 
In simple words, it lets one software to talk/communicate to another software. APIs are pivitol as it allows developers to access the features without having to understand the underlying massive scripts and code. In our case the weather app that I'm presenting today is a best example of an API. Their functionality make them very easy to use in everyday life (well for a developer atleast).
I have used OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data & use the requests library in Python to fetch the weather API.
The program prompts the user to enter the name of their city, once entered, it displays the temperature in Â°C metrics, along with a short description of in a word.
This is one of the many upcoming projects leveling up everytime.
